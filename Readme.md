#FinTech Case Study

**Overview and Origin**

*Name of Company
SoFi or Social Finance, Inc.

* When was the company incorporated?*
Sofi was founded in 2011 in California.

* Who are the founders of the company?*
Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnegan, and Ian Brady

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?*
Mike Cagney while attending Standfords business school was looking for “new business ideas in finance” [^2].

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*  	Initial funding was $2 million provided by alumni. The investment came from “40 Stanford business school alumni who gave an average of $50,000 each” (carrns, 2012). The following year the program was expanded to 40 schools and $150 million dollars [^2].

** Business Activities:**

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?*
Student loans are extremely expensive and lead to student debt. Mike Cagney was trying to find more affordable options for students financing college.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  *
Initially it was for students financing their college education and gathering investors from among the alumni of Stanford university. It was a type of peer-to-peer lending model, or as Mike Cagney referred to it as a “group to group approach” [^7].

*Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?*
Current students attending college are around 19.9 million [^9].

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)* 
The Sofi model offers a lower interest rate than government loans for consolidation loans and new loans.  SoFi initially came from alumnis. They felt that alumnis using it as an investment too would be vested in the success of the graduates [^7].

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? * 
Currently according to stackshare Sofi tech stack consists of applications in the following areas:  application and data, utilities, devops, business tools. They are currently using 31 application and data systems, 13 utilities, 30 devops, and 7 business tools.[^3]  

**Landscape:**

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?*
	SoFi or social finance, inc. is in the alternative finance area of fintech. They started off linking alumni and students together in the student lending of college loans.  They are also generally in in refinancing, mortgages, personal lending, and wealth management [^3].


* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?*
Over time the importance of alternative lending is definitely on the rise. There have been many innovations that have basically allowed borrowers to cut out banks.  Peer-to-peer lending (P2P) started as a FinTech innovation  and helped to cut out traditional lending sources due to increased transparency, greater efficiency, and lower costs (cd insights, 2018). Innovations in FinTech have allowed usage of Big Data to help circumvent traditional lending metrics and provide a higher level of customers service and reduced turn around on loans [^6]. These reduced turn arounds have been possible due to the automation of underwriting.  The use of powerful algorithms and Big Data have made this possible [^5]. Tradional metrics for loan worthiness are no longer employeed. Big Data allows the use of a multitude of other data points that allow companies to tailor their credit worthiness criteria. This has allowed for alternative finance to enter into fields that larger and older institutions avoid or will not do business with.  An example of this is the growing marijuana industry[^6].
By 2017 there had been many mergers and aquisitions in addition to shutdowns of some alternative finance companies [^10].
So far government regulations is still behind the innovation, but does not seem to be too far off into the future.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?*
Sofi has definitely been branching into other alternative lending areas since its inception. Some of its competition in the area of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending include Quicken Loans, Kaggabe, and Paypal [^4].   


Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?*
Sofi has continued to grow since its inception.  As of 2019 SoFi “closed a $500 million funding round led by Qatar Investoment Authority[^4]. “The continued funding and continued expansion of their business into other areas of alternative finance has made SoFi capable of “posing a threat to incumbent banks[^4].”

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success?* 
The core metrics for companies in the FinTech area are hard to pin down.  Traditional metrics used for established banking institutions do not really apply to the FinTech sphere.  The business though they participate in the same activities conduct business in completely different ways and thus lead to the necessity to use new metrics to value the business.  It has been proposed that despite this difficulty that the following four areas might be helpfull:  Trust, Growth, Management of Risk and Scalabiilty[^8].

*How is your company performing, based on these metrics?*
Though the metrics are of their own making I will address the  categories briefly.  Trust:  SoFi started out by combining alumni and students from the same instituion together insuring mutal desire for the completion of study and repayment of loans.  Growth:  the initial success has led to continued growth and continued funding from outside sources.  Risk: the ability to evaluate risk base on new criteria using big data has so far led to continued investment.
Scalability:  The platform has continued to grow, received increased funding, and branched out from its original loan scheme. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?*
I believe SoFi is performing well.  They have branched out from college loans to a broad range of products and services.  They now do private and personal loans in addition to mortgages.  They offer a credit card and credit monitoring services and investment vehicals and platforms, and they are now in the insurance game..  The technologies are accessable from hand held devices as you would expect from a FinTech organization.  I think the beauty in this despite the fickle nature of people is that starting with student loans it provides access to you people to tools that will grow with them as they become more sophisticated.  

**Recommendations**

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)*

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?*
SoFi despite their array of product they currently do not offer specific  auto loans.  I think entering the auto market would make sense based on their current expansion of loan and investment products.  I think this would benefit SoFi for a number of reasons.  First they are already in the loan business and are dealing with a younger market.  Second there is the ability to consolidate loans or generate new ones with existing customers. Thirdly, vehicles are a reality of everyday like and in addition to student loans, it is one of the next loans that college grad take out after funding college followed by possible their biggest life purchase of a home,  

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?*
They would be able to utilize their existing structure.  Since big data is in the quiver of FinTech companies and the old rules no longer apply to loans.  The initiation of car loans and evaluation for risk should be a smaller hurdle to overcome than their initial business of student loans. I would propose that their existing customer base would have graduated and secured a job by the time they need to buy a new car
